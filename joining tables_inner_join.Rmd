Joining tables is incredibly useful when you have to download several data files on a common set of subjects and then aggregate them into a larger, singular data set. In dplyr package, the joining functions are known as mutating joins. There are 4 mutating joins in dplyr package:

1.  `inner_join()`

2.  `left_join()`

3.  `right_join()`

4.  `full_join()`

## Load the library

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## create employee table

```{r}

employee_table <- tibble(Employee_ID = c(12320,	11450,	10453,	23190,	15431,	14290,	18790,	11540,	15340,	9821),
                         Employee_Name = c("Paul", "Andrew", "Samantha", "Gayatri", "Raghav", "Siddharth", "Roger", "Christine", "Julia", "Andrew")) 

employee_table

```

## create department table

```{r}

employee_department <- tibble(Employee_ID = c(12320,	11450,	10453,	23190,	15431,	14290,	18790),
                         Department = c("Finance", "Quality", "Operations", "Marketing", "HR", "Sales", "HR"))

employee_department
```

## create course enrollment table

```{r}

course_enrollment <- tibble(Employee_number = c(11450,	10453,	15431,	18790),
                         Course_enrolled = c("YES", "YES", "YES", "YES"))

course_enrollment
```

## Concept of key-value pair:

### The variable used to connect each pair of table is called *keys*. A key is a variable that uniquely identifies an observation.

#### The observations that are attached to the key variable are called as *value.*

#### In this example: *key* is Seller (common column), and Product, Amount are *values.*

![](key-value%20pair.png){width="705"}

| Key   | Product | Amount |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Adam  | Bananas | \$705  |
| Harry | Oranges | \$605  |

### All the `*_join()` functions in dplyr uses this key-value pair concept to join the tables.

## Perform `inner_join()`

### Only keeps the observations in Data frame 1 that have a matching key in Data frame 2. So, in `inner_join()` there may be a data loss in the resulting data frame.

In other words, `inner_join()` returns all matching observations between two data frames.

![](inner_join.png)

```{r}

employee_table %>%
  inner_join(employee_department,join_by("Employee_ID"))

```

## In `inner_join()`, does the order of joining the tables matter?

```{r}

employee_department %>%
  inner_join(employee_table,join_by("Employee_ID"))

```

Summary:

-   All the `*_join()` functions in dplyr uses key-value pair concept to join the tables. The variable used to connect each pair of table is called *keys*.

    The observations that are attached to key variable are called as values.

-   `inner_join()` returns all matching observations between two data frames.

-   The joining order of data frame in `inner_join()` does not matter
