Joining tables is incredibly useful when you have to download several data files on a common set of subjects and then aggregate them into a larger, singular data set. In dplyr package, the joining functions are known as mutating joins. There are 4 mutating joins in dplyr package:

1 `inner_join()`

2 `left_join()`

3 `right_join()`

4 `full_join()`

## Load the library

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## create employee table

```{r}

employee_table <- tibble(Employee_ID = c(12320,	11450,	10453,	23190,	15431,	14290,	18790,	11540,	15340,	9821),
                         Employee_Name = c("Paul", "Andrew", "Samantha", "Gayatri", "Raghav", "Siddharth", "Roger", "Christine", "Julia", "Andrew")) 

employee_table

```

## create department table

```{r}

employee_department <- tibble(Employee_ID = c(12320,	11450,	10453,	23190,	15431,	14290,	18790),
                         Department = c("Finance", "Quality", "Operations", "Marketing", "HR", "Sales", "HR"))

employee_department
```

## create course enrollment table

```{r}

course_enrollment <- tibble(Employee_number = c(11450,	10453,	15431,	18790),
                         Course_enrolled = c("YES", "YES", "YES", "YES"))

course_enrollment
```

## Concept of key-value pair:

### The variable used to connect each pair of table is called *keys*. A key is a variable that uniquely identifies an observation.

### The observations that are attached to the key variable are called as *value.*

### In this example: *key* is Seller (common column), and Product, Amount are *values.*

![](key-value%20pair.png){width="663"}

| Key   | Product | Amount |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Adam  | Bananas | \$705  |
| Harry | Oranges | \$605  |

### All the `*_join()` functions in dplyr uses this key-value pair concept to join the tables.

## Perform `inner_join()`

### Only keeps the observations in Data frame 1 that have a matching key in Data frame 2. So, in `inner_join()` there may be a data loss in the resulting data frame.

In other words, `inner_join()` returns all matching observations between two data frames.

![](inner_join.png)

```{r}

employee_table %>%
  inner_join(employee_department,join_by("Employee_ID"))
```

## In `inner_join()`, does the order of joining the tables matter?

```{r}
employee_department %>%
  inner_join(employee_table,join_by("Employee_ID"))
```

Summary:

-   All the `*_join()` functions in dplyr uses key-value pair concept to join the tables. The variable used to connect each pair of table is called *keys*.

    The observations that are attached to key variable are called as values.

-   `inner_join()` returns all matching observations between two data frames.

-   The joining order of data frame in `inner_join()` does not matter

## Perform `left_join()`

### Keeps all observations in Data frame 1 and matching observations in Data frame 2

A left join returns all rows from the left data frame and any matching rows from the right data frame.

![](left%20join.png)

```{r}

employee_table %>%
  left_join(employee_department,join_by(Employee_ID))

```

## In `left_join()`, does order of joining the tables matter?

```{r}

 employee_department %>%
  left_join(employee_table,join_by(Employee_ID))

```

## Perform `right_join()`

### Keeps all observations in Data frame 2 and matching observations in Data frame 1

A right join returns all rows from the right data frame and any matching rows from the left data frame.

![](right%20join.png)

```{r}

employee_table %>%
  right_join(course_enrollment,join_by(Employee_ID == Employee_number))

```

## In `right_join()`, does order of joining the tables matter?

```{r}
course_enrollment %>%
  right_join(employee_table,join_by(Employee_number==Employee_ID))
```

## Perform `full_join()`

### Keeps all observations Data frame 1 and Data frame 2

![](full%20join.png)

```{r}

employee_table %>%
  full_join(employee_department,join_by(Employee_ID))

```

## In `full_join()`, does order of joining the tables matter?

```{r}
employee_department %>%
  full_join(employee_table,join_by(Employee_ID))
```

## Combining tables with one to many relationships!

## Create Project allocation table

```{r}
project_allocation <- tibble(Employee_ID = c(12320,	12320,	15431,	15431,	15431,	14290,	14290),
                         Project_Name = c("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Alpha_1", "Beta_1", "Gamma_1", "Beta_1")) 
project_allocation
```

## Join the tables together

```{r}
employee_table %>%
  left_join(project_allocation,join_by(Employee_ID))

```

Summary:

-   A `right_join()` returns all rows from the right data frame and any matching rows from the left data frame.

-   A `left_join()` returns all rows from the left data frame and any matching rows from the right data frame.

-   Both `right_join()` and `left_join()` , the joining order of the tables are important.

-   A `full_join()` keeps all observations from Data frame 1 and Data frame 2

-   If the key column names of the joining tables are different, we need to explicitly mention the matching key columns using equality operator.

-   In case of one to many tabular relationship, multiple key value pairs are returned in the combined table.
